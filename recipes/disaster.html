        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>The inevitable destination we as a society are currently marching towards, disaster pairs real well with a fresh salad and red wine! </p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A global population of approximately 8 billion</li>
            <li>Two to three technological revolutions</li>
            <li>Trillions of dollars</li>
            <li>A dash of power</li>
            <li>Pinch of greed</li>
            <li>An ear of corn, pre-shucked OR bread crumbs</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pre heat the oven to 450 </li>
            <li>Let your global population hit a good 8 billion or so. This may take a while, so patience is a virtue.</li>
            <li>While your population is growing, every once in a while, drop in a technological revolution to add some flavor.</li>
            <li>After the population hits the prescribed number, distribute the wealth, greed, and power to small proportions of it. Let's say .01% of the total population.</li>
            <li>Watch as that small percentage of people totally and completely screws over the rest of your dish. To mitigate any kind of boiling over, drop a few kernels of corn or bread crumbs among the rabble.</li>
            <li>The oven should be done preheating. Stick your head in and await the sweet embrace of death so you can avoid the consequences of your actions.</li>
        </ol>

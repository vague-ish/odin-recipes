        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>An integral part of a balanced breakfast, who doesn't like three slices of toast? A slick metal holder adds some extra iron for those of us whose blood may not be up to snuff!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Three slices of your favorite bread. It must be three exactly or none of this works, no substitutes.</li>
            <li>Metal toast rack</li>
            <li>(Optional) Topping of choice</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place toast in toaster and set the toaster to your preferred toasting time.</li>
            <li>While awaiting the toast to toast, prep your metal holder by rinsing it and then placing it on a counter. Drying is optional.</li>
            <li>Toast is ready when it pops out. It's extra ready if it's launched into the ceiling or maybe your eye.</li>
            <li>Place toast in rack</li>
            <li>(Optional) Drench the toast and holder with your topping of choice.</li>
            <li>Voila! Your toast is ready. Best eaten by unhinging your jaw and consuming everything at once.
            </li>
        </ol>
